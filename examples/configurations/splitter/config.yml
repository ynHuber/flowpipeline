# Produce flow messages back to a Kafka topic. In this case, a topic-suffix is
# set and thus the producer will produce to multiple topics, depending on the
# suffix. A suffix can be any field in a flow representation and should
# therefore be limited to a number of possibilities. In this example, we're
# using the customer ID field from an enriched flow to sort flows of different
# customers into their own topics, which can be made available to a customer
# later on.
